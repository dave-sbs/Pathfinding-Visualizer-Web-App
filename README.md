# Pathfinding Visualizer Web App

<img width="1470" alt="Preview for Pathfinding Visualizer" src="https://github.com/dave-sbs/Pathfinding-Visualizer-Web-App/assets/117487090/1601de5f-a631-4210-837f-8d84b1abbf6a">

The Pathfinding Visualizer Web App is a tool built using React and JavaScript that allows users to interactively visualize various pathfinding algorithms in action. This app provides a hands-on experience for understanding how algorithms like Dijkstra's, A*, and more work in finding the shortest path between two points on a grid.

## Features

- Interactive grid-based visualization of pathfinding algorithms.
- Supports various algorithms including Dijkstra's, A*, Depth First Search, and Breadth First Search.
- Start and end point customization.
- Maze placement to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Different maze-generation algorithms.
- Step-by-step visualization for better understanding.
- Options to clear the path and clear the walls.

## Getting Started

*DISCLAIMER: I am currently working on hosting the project on GitHub. I am currently trying to fix a very weird bug that is messing with my gh-build branch. Will host the project as soon as I fix the bug.

To run the Pathfinding Visualizer Web App locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dave-sbs/Pathfinding-Visualizer-Web-App.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd pathfinding-visualizer
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Usage

1. Choose a start point and an end point on the grid. 
2. Click on the grid cells to place obstacles (walls).
3. Select a pathfinding algorithm from the options.
4. Click the "Visualize" button to watch the algorithm in action.
5. Observe how the algorithm finds the shortest path from the start point to the end point while avoiding obstacles.

## Supported Algorithms

- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Algorithm
- DFS
- BFS

## Maze Generation Algorithms

- Vertical Maze
- Horizontal Maze
- Recursive Division Maze

## Technologies Used

- React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for the app's logic.
- CSS: Styling the components and layout.
