TASKS AHEAD
    MVP
1. Rewrite the remaining algorithms
2. ALSO I HAVE AN ERROR WHERE THE WALLS CAN BE DRAWN ON TOP OF THE START AND END NODES. CAUSES A LOT OF PROBLEMS SOLVE IT ASAP!!!
13. Post on github
14. Add metrics and analysis section
9. I need to figure out a way to move the start and end nodes while the search algo updates in real time. Probably will have to do something with the datastructure storing the visited nodes
4. Add the speed and maybe even grid size adjuster 
7. Maybe think of using multiple start nodes that map to the same finish node - EXTENSION
10. Clean up code using chatGPT. But before that create a Github repo and do version control to show that I actually did all the coding before final clean up

    UI TASKS

    CURRENT FOCUS
2. Implement the clear functions
    - Need to figure out clear Board
1. Implement the remaining algorithms
3. Get online code for maze generator & implement - pretty easy. Already implemented one.
14. Add metrics and analysis section

    DONE
6. Adjust code to make start and finish nodes to be movable
2. Implement the clear functions.
1. Section out the different parts of the page
2. Implement Navbar
5. Improve wall drawing AND final path animation and create tighter grid. Don't really hate the presentation I have rn tbh.
12. Improve CSS Layout
3. Figure out layout of footer and placing the elements in the right place
12. Improve CSS Layout - I think I am happy with the current layout. Need to finish footer
2. Debug wall issue - I think it's solved. Would've been ideal if I could just adjust it once I have placed the start node and handleMouseUp() has been called but because of my re-animation thing, it might cause issues. 
11. Add Icons on top of start and finish nodes - Kinda handled by just keeping the start and finish nodes unchanged
15. Add speed adjuster

    THOUGHTS
The new Github repo I found is soooo helpful
Showed me so many of my code inefficiencies
Mainly cause I didn't really pre-plan how I was going to implement the methods I just followed Clement
So I have a lot of inefficiencies and logic falacies
    - One issue is with the way I am handling start and end nodes and coordinates in particular
    - Contributes to how my clearBoard() is implemented... in turn affects maze generation
    - Additionally, I just generally think Rohi has been using more efficient use of javascript methods and just state changes and all that. 
    - A lot to learn and a lot to emulate
